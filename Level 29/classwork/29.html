            <h1>mother</h1>
            <p>A mother is the female parent of a child. A woman may be considered a mother by virtue of having given birth,
                by raising a child who may or may not be her biological offspring, or by supplying her ovum for fertilisation
                in the case of gestational surrogacy.

                A biological <i>mother</i> is the <b>female genetic contributor</b> to the creation of the infant, through sexual
                intercourse or egg donation. A biological mother may have legal obligations to a child not raised by her,
                <u>such as an obligation of monetary support</u>. <b>An adoptive mother is a female who has become the child's
                parent</b> through the legal process of adoption. A putative mother is a female whose biological relationship
                to a child is alleged but has not been established. A stepmother is a non-biological female parent married
                to a child's preexisting parent, and may form a family unit but generally does not have the legal rights
                and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child.
                
                A father is the male counterpart of a mother. Women who are pregnant may be referred to as expectant mothers
                or mothers-to-be.[1][2] The process of becoming a mother has been referred to as "matrescence".[3]
                
                The adjective "maternal" refers to a mother and comparatively to "paternal" for a father.
                The verb "to mother" means to procreate or to sire a child, or to provide care for a child,
                from which also derives the noun "mothering".[4] Related terms of endearment are
                <i><b><u> mom mama,  mommy,  mum  mummy,  mumsy,  mamacita  ma,  mama and  mammy</u></b></i>. A female role model that children
                can look up to is sometimes referred to as a mother-figure.</p>
