        Toyota Motor Corporation (Japanese: トヨタ自動車株式会社, Hepburn: Toyota Jidōsha kabushikigaisha, IPA: [toꜜjota], English: /toyotə/, <br>
        commonly known as simply Toyota) is a Japanese multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in Toyota City, Aichi, Japan. <br>
        it was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda and incorporated on August 28, 1937. Toyota is the largest automobile manufacturer in the world, <br>
        producing about 10 million vehicles per year. <br>
        
        The company was originally founded as a spinoff of Toyota Industries, a machine maker started by Sakichi Toyoda, Kiichiro's father. <br>
        Both companies are now part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the world. While still a department of Toyota Industries <br>
        the company developed its first product, the Type A engine, in 1934 and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA. <br>

        After World War II, Toyota benefited from Japan's alliance with the United States to learn from American automakers and other companies, <br>
        which gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed <br>
        the small company into a leader in the industry and was the subject of many academic studies. <br>
