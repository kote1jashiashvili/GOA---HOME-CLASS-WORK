            <b> The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. <br>
                It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the <br>
                domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and farm cat, but <br>
                also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to <br>
                kill vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, <br>
                flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is <br>
                a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizationsâ€”including <br>
                meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as body language. It can hear sounds too faint or <br>
                too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones. <br>
